                                Hong Kong, and Taiwan. From 1947 to the early 1970s, Chinese immigrants 
                                to Canada came mostly from Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Southeast Asia.

                                In 1908, the Immigration Act was amended to include the Government of Canada's 
                                "continuous journey regulation" which prohibited the landing of any immigrant 
                                who did not come to Canada by continuous journey from the country of which they 
                                were natives or citizens. This created a significant barrier to immigrants from 
                                South Asia as trips from most of the region included stops.

                                Columbia in May 1914. Its passengers, mostly Sikhs from Punjab, India, and all 
                                British subjects, challenged the continuous journey regulation of Canada's 
                                Immigration Act, which had been put in place in part to limit immigration from non-European countries.
                                They were not allowed in.
