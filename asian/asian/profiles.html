                        There has been a significant history of Chinese immigration 
                        to Canada, with the first settlement of Chinese people in Canada 
                        being in the 1780s.[1] The major periods of Chinese immigration 
                        would take place from 1858 to 1923 and 1947 to the present day, 
                        reflecting changes in the Canadian government's immigration policy.
                        Chinese immigrants were initially sought after by Canadian 
                        employers as a source of cheap labour due to Canada's relative 
                        wealth at the time and the difficult economic conditions in China.

                        Chinese immigrants faced an extreme amount of racism. In 1885, the 
                        Canadian government made Chinese people pay a “head tax.” People 
                        from China needed to pay it to come to Canada. The goal was to 
                        stop Chinese immigration. Most white people in BC did not want 
                        the Chinese to live there. Chinese people kept coming to BC though.
                        The government created the Chinese Immigration Act in 1923. 
                        This Act banned most Chinese people from coming to Canada.

                        The government cut costs by employing Chinese workers to build 
                        the Canadian Pacific Railway. In the 1880s, about 15,000 Chinese 
                        men built the railroad in BC. This was a dangerous job. Probably 
                        more than 600 died. This led to increased settlemet of Chinese 
                        workers.

                        called Nisei (second generation), have faced prejudice and discrimination.

                        than Caucasians.

                        In response to the fear of Japanese people during WW2, the government passed an order that allowed for the 
                        removal of so-called enemy aliens from the coast of British Columbia. Japanese 
                        Canadians were given 24 hours to pack before being forced to leave their homes, 
                        only able to bring what they could carry. Women, children, and elderly were sent 
                        to internment camps in the Interior of B.C., while men were separated from their 
                        families and forced into work crews building roads and railways and working on farms.

                        The majority of South Asian Canadians were born in India, where many 
                        languages and hundreds of discrete ethnic groups exist. Attracted by 
                        high Canadian wages, they soon found work. Immigration increased quickly 
                        thereafter and totaled 5,209 by the end of 1908. Nearly all of these immigrants 
                        were men who had temporarily left their families to find employment in 
                        Canada. These people faced extreme discrimination and were thought to 
                        be stealing jobs. In 1908, the Immigration Act was amended to include 
                        the Government of Canada's "continuous journey regulation" which prohibited 
                        the landing of any immigrant who did not come to Canada by continuous journey.
                        The Komogata Maru challenged this idea, but faced many challenges along
                        the way, yet were stuck at dock and unable to enter. They were starved.

                        Early Sikhs in British Columbia were almost exclusively involved in 
                        the lumber industry. They are still active in this industry, both as 
                        workers and mill owners. Until 1965, South Asian politics were devoted 
                        primarily to lobbying for the elimination of the legal restrictions enacted 
                        by the BC Legislature and to changing immigration laws. Since then, South 
                        Asians have become increasingly involved on other political fronts. Their 
                        associations now actively lobby for government support for cultural programs, 
                        for greater access to immigration, and for government action to reduce prejudice 
                        and discrimination.

                        Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, refugees facing possible 
                        persecution and difficult living conditions fled from Vietnam. Many 
                        Vietnamese people braved the dangerous jungle or sea to reach neighbouring 
                        countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. There, 
                        they were crowded into refugee camps with the hope of finding a new home. 
                        Moved by the dramatic images of refugees stranded aboard the cargo ship Hai 
                        Hong in 1978, tens of thousands of Canadians and many organizations registered 
                        to sponsor refugees. Between 1975 and the early 1990s, Canada accepted some 
                        200,000 of these refugees thanks to its immigration policies and the support 
                        of Canadians. Canadians across the country helped refugees resettle and 
                        rebuild their lives through sponsorship programs. Once settled, the Vietnamese 
                        people made numerous contributions to Canada's economic prosperity and 
                        proudly shared their culture with Canadians.

                        One Vietnamese person shared their story of their Immigration.
                        "My maternal grandfather was the force behind our family's move to the 
                        other side of the world. My parents were dating at the time and my dad 
                        joined my mother's family on the perilous journey, leaving behind his own 
                        parents. They surrendered their fates to the ocean and the immigration system."
