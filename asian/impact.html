                        Sikhs from Punjab, India came to British Columbia to work 
                        in the lumber, mining, and railway industries, and later in agriculture. 
                        The Chinese also contributed greatly to the economy with labour and 
                        building for cheap like the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Japanese had 
                        lots of fishing boats. Vietnamese Canadians work in many different 
                        sectors of Canada's economy, notably manufacturing and scientific 
                        and technical occupations. Many Vietnamese Canadians are also entrepreneurs, 
                        owning and operating businesses such as restaurants and grocery stores.

                        Since 1900, Chinese Canadians have settled primarily in urban areas, 
                        particularly in Vancouver and Toronto. They have contributed to every 
                        aspect of Canadian society, from literature to sports, politics to civil 
                        rights, film to music, business to philanthropy, and education to religion.
                        This includes many restaurants like in Chinatown which is a well known thing.
                        Vietnamese cuisine is popular throughout Canada from things like pho. 
                        The Indian influence on Canadian culture can be seen in various aspects, 
                        including food, language, music, fashion, and traditions. There are many 
                        Indian restaurants. Japanese food is also very popular.

                        The Chinese faced much discrimination throughout the years. Initially, they
                        were faced with the Head Tax, then the Immigration Act, both systemic forms
                        to stop Chinese Immigration. They were also seen as enemy aliens and were
                        payed significantly less. Through efforts, they were able to achieve better
                        rights and abolish these acts. South Asians were discriminated against too 
                        with the Continuous Journey Act. They were thought to be stealing jobs. 
                        They greatly contributed to the economy. The Japanese were interned and 
                        deported. They were able to achieve their rights back and advocated for 
                        justice. The Vietnamese initially came due to being refugees. They 
                        contributed a lot to society through economic prosperity.
