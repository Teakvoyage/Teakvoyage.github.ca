                    Belief Systems
                </h2>
                <p class="articleText blackishText">
                    In common with the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya believed in a supernatural realm inhabited 
                    by an array of powerful deities who needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual 
                    practices. At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, 
                    who would intercede for their living descendants in dealings with the supernatural realm. 
                    The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural were shamans. Maya ritual 
                    included the use of hallucinogens for chilan, oracular priests. Visions for the chilan were likely 
                    facilitated by consumption of water lilies, which are hallucinogenic in high doses. As the 
                    Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the Maya world view into religious cults 
                    that justified their right to rule.

                    Temples
                </h2>
                <p class="articleText blackishText">
                    Temples were sometimes referred to in hieroglyphic texts as k'uh nah, meaning "god's house". 
                    Temples were raised on platforms, most often upon a pyramid. The earliest temples were probably 
                    thatched huts built upon low platforms. By the Late Preclassic period, their walls were of stone, 
                    and the development of the corbel arch allowed stone roofs to replace thatch. By the Classic period, 
                    temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as 
                    a foundation for monumental art. Temple shrines contained one to three rooms, and were dedicated to 
                    important deities. Such a deity might be one of the patron gods of the city, or a deified ancestor. 
                    In general, freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors.

                    Human sacrifice
                </h2>
                <p class="articleText blackishText">
                    Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of 
                    a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life 
                    was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated 
                    in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower 
                    status captives being used for labour.
