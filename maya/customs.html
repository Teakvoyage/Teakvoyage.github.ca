                    Mayan symbols are a rich source of material culture for the Central American civilization. Symbols can be anything, a gesture, a song, a phrase or an image. They often carry many layers of meaning that everyone in the culture understands intuitively. Hundreds of Mayan symbols can be found carved on stone, which allows archeologists and other researchers to gain an understanding of their culture. In fact, Mayan writing consists of symbols called glyphs. Of the hundreds of Mayan symbols, some appear more often on the carved stelae and temple walls in Mayan cities, revealing their importance to the culture. Glyphs of animals were powerful symbols to the Mayans, especially the jaguar and the eagle.

                    Traditional Dances and Rituals
                </h2>
                <p class="articleText blackishText">
                    Dance from pre-Columbian Maya culture still exists in various altered forms today. However, dancing in the ancient world carried a much deeper significance in their sophisticated culture. Records of these dances have come to light through various murals, codices, and especially the Spaniards who first recorded their observations. The dancers in Mayan culture were known as Humul dancers. In Mayan culture dancer's have a purpose which is to tell stories. A story is told by the movement of the dances they perform. The dancers may go on for hours depending on the length of the story. The racks worn on the back of the dancers are made of lightweight materials like feathers and bamboo. Most of the forms found on the backrack are symbols acquired over the years

                <p class="articleText blackishText">
                    Maya ceremonies included the ball game, human sacrifice, and bloodletting ceremonies in which nobles pierced their tongues or genitals to shed blood as an offering to the gods. It is hard to know of specific practices due to the collapse of the Maya and the lack of recording for the common people.
