                    The Maya Empire, centered in the tropical lowlands of what is now Guatemala, reached 
                    the peak of its power and influence around the sixth century A.D. The Maya excelled at 
                    agriculture, pottery, writing, calendars and mathematics, and left behind an astonishing 
                    amount of impressive architecture and symbolic artwork. Most of the great stone cities 
                    of the Maya were abandoned by A.D. 900, however, and since the 19th century scholars have 
                    debated what might have caused this dramatic decline.

                <p class="articleText blackishText">
                    While the origins of Maya culture remain murky, it's thought to have first emerged between 
                    7000 B.C. and 2000 B.C., when hunter-gatherers abandoned their nomadic habits and created 
                    more permanent settlements. Recent analyses suggest that those first settlers came from 
                    South America and likely developed their staple food, maize, by 4000 B.C. Maize cultivation 
                    dramatically changed the Maya's trajectory, literally fueling the explosion of their society 
                    and culture.

                    The Maya Currently
                </h2>
                <p class="articleText blackishText">
                    From the late eighth through the end of the ninth century, something unknown happened to 
                    shake the Maya civilization to its foundations. One by one, the Classic cities in the 
                    southern lowlands were abandoned, and by A.D. 900, Mayan civilization in that region had 
                    collapsed. The reason for this mysterious decline is unknown, though scholars have developed 
                    several competing theories. Some believe that by the ninth century the Maya had exhausted 
                    the environment around them to the point that it could no longer sustain a very large population.

                            Preclassic period (2000 BC - 250 AD)

                            The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the 
                            Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops 
                            of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterised by sedentary communities 
                            and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines.

                            Classic period (250-900 AD)

                            The Classic period is largely defined as the period during which the lowland Maya raised dated 
                            monuments using the Long Count calendar. This period marked the peak of large-scale construction 
                            and urbanism, the recording of monumental inscriptions, and demonstrated significant intellectual 
                            and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions. The Classic period Maya 
                            political landscape has been likened to that of Renaissance Italy or Classical Greece, with 
                            multiple city-states engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities.

                            During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by 
                            the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties, and a northward shift in activity. No universally 
                            accepted theory explains this collapse, but it likely had a combination of causes, including endemic 
                            internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation, and drought.

                            Highlands; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, because many Postclassic 
                            Maya groups had migration myths.

                            escaped. From 1517 to 1519, three separate Spanish expeditions explored the Yucatán coast, and 
                            engaged in a number of battles with the Maya inhabitants.
