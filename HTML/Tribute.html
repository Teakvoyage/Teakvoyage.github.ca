<pre><h3>	About</h3></pre>
<pre><p>		Terry Fox was unsually determined to achieve his goals.
		He had been diagnosed with osteogenic sarcoma above 
		his knee. His leg had been amputated. This did not
		stop him. His experience with cancer led to his new
		determination to help fund cancer research to help
		others like him and prevent the same from happening.
</p></pre>
<br>
<pre><h3>	Accomplishments	</h3></pre>
<pre><p>		Terry Fox's achievements are widespread and long-lasting.
		He had achieved his goal of $1 from every Canadian.
		This is an amazing amount of money, but that was
		not all he did. He set in motion and event that
		is called the Terry Fox Run where, every year,
		people run to support his cause and raise money.
		This has raised over $850 million!
