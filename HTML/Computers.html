What Is Computer?
</u>
</b>
</h3>
<p>
Computers are widely available and complete many useful tasks. 
But what are they? A computer is an electronic device. Some 
examples you might have or see are laptops, phones or PCs.
This device would take an input from you or anything else, then
output a result. It stores and manipulates data to process it
into a meaningful result. They run using electricity to follow
instructions. Computers allow you to do many things. It allows 
you to connect with others online through messaging and video. 
It allows you to write and print a document. You can research 
information through web browsers. All together it makes a 
very useful system for many different things.

<u>
What Are Inputs and Outputs?
</u>
</b>
</h3>
<p>
Computers follow instructions but they don't know how to do 
things themselves. A computer system takes in input from you,
the user, and outputs it. Input devices allow you to 
communicate with the computer to get it to do what you want.
It uses data sent from devices. Some examples include,
a mouse which allows you to interact with on screen elements,
and a keyboard which allows you to input language characters and
input commands. Output devices show you the result of the
calculations and instructions, allowing the computer to
communicate the results to you. Some output devices are, 
the monitor which shows whats happening on the computer in
a way you can understand. Another example is a speaker which
outputs sound that you can hear like music. So without
the input or output, a computer is completely useless to you.

What Is The Software and Hardware?
</u>
</b>
</h3>
<p>
The computer can complete all these wonderful tasks. But how do
they actually do it? It can do this because a computer system is made 
up of software and hardware. Hardware is what you can actually 
touch while the software are the instructions to perform tasks.
The hardware is a collection of many different devices for 
different purposes. It performs the calculations and everything.
The software is the instructions run on the hardware. A system
software unifies all the hardware and runs a base level of
functionality. Application software can run specific tasks on
top of the system software. For example a game or web browser.
That's how the hardware and software can run many amazing 
programs that is easy to use.
