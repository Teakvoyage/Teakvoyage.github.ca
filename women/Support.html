1) Donate
</h3>

<p class="body-content">
To uplift women in a positive way you can donate to an organization that helps women. These organizations or charities can help support equality and the goals of Internation Women's Day with your help. Examples are "Girls Who Code" who educated girls about different opportunities and aim to close the gender pay gap.

To help in person and show your support you can attend events. Attending these events helps their cause. One example of an event is the "Impact the Future: Celebration of IWD 2024" event where you can help. Participating can help you learn and help women with equality.

You can educate those around you who have sexist behaviour or say harmful things. Help those around you learn. You can also do research and educate yourself on history. For example, you can learn about how International Women's Day started and what is being done to help the goal of equality.
